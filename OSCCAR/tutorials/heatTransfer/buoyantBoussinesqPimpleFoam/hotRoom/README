This is a copy of the buoyantBoussinesqPimpleFoam tutorial hotRoom, adjusted
to work with the wallHeatFluxIncompressible utility. Files that need to be
added are constant/turbulenceProperties and constant/thermophysicalProperties
(see wallHeatFluxIncompressible utility for example entries of the latter).
