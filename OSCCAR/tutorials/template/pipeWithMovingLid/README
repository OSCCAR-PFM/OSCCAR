Tutorial:    channelWithMovingWall
Solver:      icoFoam


Description:

This is a basic tutorial as an example case to start from. This tutorial is
a simple square channel with a moving top wall.

After running icoFoam the user can run the sample utility to sample velocity
along a vertical line in the channel. In the gnuplot directory there is a
gnuplot script to plot the horizontal velocity to a png graph. The graph is
stored in the images directory in the case.
