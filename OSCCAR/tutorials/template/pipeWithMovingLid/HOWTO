This file contains tips on how to put together a good tutorial case in terms
of content, but certainly also (re)usability.

* Include the date
  + Simply type "date" in the terminal and paste the date as above.

* Include a README file
  + Explain what the idea is behind the tutorial, what solver, what is tested
    and/or shown and why. Also include what is the expected results and
    possible problems, e.g. pressure drop.
  + An example README file is included in this directory.

* Include an Allrun and Allclean script, however simple.
  + These scripts are a great way to preserve what you have done, for yourself
    and others.
    
* Follow OpenFOAM's code style guide
  + OpenFOAM's style guide is available as org-mode file (use emacs):
    $WM_PROJECT_DIR/doc/codingStyleGuide.org
    or as pdf:
    $WM_PROJECT_DIR/doc/codingStyleGuide.pdf

* Case structure
  + The case contains
    ++ Allrun
       A script containing the steps to run the tutorial. The Allrun script is
       a bash script that is executed by typing "./Allrun".
    ++ Allclean
       Also a script, but to clean up the case.
    ++ README
       A text file describing the tutorial; what solver was used, what is the
       tutorial supposed to show, any special things to notice.
    ++ HOWTO
       This file, not needed for standard tutorials.
    ++ 0
       Directory containing initial values and boundary conditions.
    ++ constant
       Directory containing the mesh and physical properties.
    ++ system
       Directory containing files that control running of the solver.
    ++ octave
       Directory containing any octave scripts that may be useful for pre-
       and/or post-processing.
    ++ gnuplot
       Directory containing gnuplot scripts for post-processing.
    ++ images
       Directory to store any images created.
    ++ video
       Directory to store images to string together a video.
  + Case structure
