Description:

This case is set up according to the square bubble column as published by
Deen et al. (2001)[1].

The case is a square bubble column of 0.15 m wide, 0.15 m deep, and 0.6 m high.
In the original case of Deen et al. (2001) the total height was 1 m. The
column is filled with water up to 0.45 m high. Air is introduced through a patch
on the bottom of 0.03 m by 0.03 m. The inlet velocity is 0.12 m/s, giving a
superficial gas velocity of 4.9e-3 m/s.

For the turbulence properties a turbulent intensity of 10% is assumed at the
inlet. This gives a value for k of 2.16e-4 m2/s2. When assuming a characteristic
length of 7% of inlet diameter, epsilon is 2.48e-4 m2/s3. At the inlet the phase
fraction is assumed 100% air and 0% water. Pressure is fixed at the outlet at
1e5 Pa.
