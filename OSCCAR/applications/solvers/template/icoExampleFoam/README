Tutorial:    cavity
Solver:      icoExampleFoam


Description:

This is a basic solver as an example to start from. The icoExampleFoam solver
is the same as icoFoam, but shows how to build and document a solver. As
example a header called myCode.H is oncluded in the solver so that code is
more modular, easier to maintain and re-usable. Also, example comments are
provided to show how to comment and structure your code for better usability
and maintainability in the OSCCAR package.

icoExampleFoam can be run on e.g.:
$OSCCAR_TUTORIALS/incompressible/icoMasslessTracerFoam/cavityClippedMasslessTracer
