[disable incorrectly set]
WARNING: The special MCA parameter "%s" was set in
an unexpected way, and is likely not working the way you want it to.

Specifically, this MCA parameter is "special" in that it can *only* be
set in the environment.  Setting this value in a file -- and sometimes
even on the command line -- will not work as intended.  The *only* way
to set this value is to set "OMPI_MCA_%s" in the environment before
starting your job.

  Value:      %d
  Source:     %s

[ummunotify eaccess]
Open MPI was unable to open the UMMU notification device.  This is
likely a permissions problem on the device itself.  UMMU notification
support is therefore disabled in this process; an alternate memory
hook manager *may* be used instead (if available).

  Local host:  %s
  UMMU device: %s
