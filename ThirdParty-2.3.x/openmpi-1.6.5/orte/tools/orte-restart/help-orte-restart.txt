[invalid_filename]
Error: The filename (%s) is invalid because either you have not provided a filename
       or provided an invalid filename.
       Please see --help for usage.

[restart_cmd_failure]
Error: Unable to obtain the proper restart command to restart from the 
       checkpoint file (%s). Returned %d.

[comp_select_failure]
Error: Unable to select the %s component needed to restart this
       application. (Returned %d)
       This likely indicates that the checkpointer needed is not 
       available on this machine. You should move to a machine that
       has this checkpointer enabled.

[restart_failure]
Error: The restart command:
          shell$ %s
       returned an error code %d, and was unable to restart properly.

[invalid_seq_num]
Error: The filename (%s) and sequence number (%d) could not be used.
       This may be caused by an invalid sequence number. Try using the
       '-i' option to determine a correct value.
