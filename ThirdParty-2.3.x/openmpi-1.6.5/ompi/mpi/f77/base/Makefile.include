# This Makefile does not stand on its own; it is included in
# ompi/mpi/Makefile.am to satisfy a complicated set of ordering issues
# when building the Fortran code.  This stub Makefile only builds a
# small number of files in the f77 directory so that they can be
# included in the main libmpi.  See comments in that Makefile.am for
# details.

# If we're building the F77 bindings, then we need to build the
# Fortran 77 glue into libmpi

# This needs to be its own convenience library because it requires
# some specialized CPPFLAGS to set all the defines in various .h files
# properly (copied from ompi/mpi/f77/Makefile.am) -- we unfortunately
# can't just suck the sources into the larger libmpi.la.
