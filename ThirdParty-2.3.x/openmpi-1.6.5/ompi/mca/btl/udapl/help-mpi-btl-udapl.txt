[invalid num rdma segments] 
WARNING: MCA parameter [btl_udapl_eager_rdma_num = %d] is not valid.
RDMA will not be used for short messages. Try setting to positive
value, e.g. 16.
#
[use default endpoint params]
WARNING: Using default uDAPL endpoint parameters not those that
would have been modified by MCA parameters.
#
[optimal buffer alignment mismatch]
WARNING: DAT_OPTIMAL_ALIGNMENT = %d : BTL buffer_alignment = %d.
The BTL buffer_alignment value may not be optimal. If all nodes
report the same DAT_OPTIMAL_ALIGNMENT value and this differs from
BTL buffer_alignment then setting "--mca btl_udapl_buffer_alignment
%d" may improve performance.
#
[max_recv_dtos too low]
WARNING: The MCA parameter max_recv_dtos has been modified to a value,
%d, that is insufficient. This value must be greater than or equal to
num_recvs, %d. The uDAPL BTL will adjust to allow the program to
proceed.
#
[max_request_dtos too low]
WARNING: The MCA parameter max_request_dtos has been modified to a
value, %d, which may not be sufficient. Try setting max_request_dtos
to %d if program fails.
#
[max_recv_dtos system max]
WARNING: The MCA parameter max_recv_dtos is trying to be set to,
%d, which is larger than allowable so the value will be set to maximum
allowed, %d.
#
[max_request_dtos system max]
WARNING: The MCA parameter max_request_dtos is trying to be set to,
%d, which is larger than allowable so the value will be set to maximum
allowed, %d.
#
[evd_qlen adapter max]
WARNING: The MCA parameter %s is trying to be set to %d,
which is larger than allowable so the value will be set to maximum
allowed, %d.
#
[evd_qlen too low]
WARNING: The MCA parameter %s has been modified to a value,
%d, which may not be sufficient. Try setting %s to %d if
program fails.
#
[connection timeout low]
WARNING: The MCA parameter %s has been modified to a value,
%d, which may not be sufficient. Try setting %s to %d if
program fails.
#
[dat_lmr_create DAT_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES] 
WARNING: The uDAPL BTL is not able to register memory. Possibly out of
allowed privileged memory (i.e. memory that can be pinned). Increasing
the allowed privileged memory may alleviate this issue.
#
[dat_ia_open fail]
WARNING: Failed to open "%s" [%s:%s]. 
This may be a real error or it may be an invalid entry in the uDAPL
Registry which is contained in the dat.conf file. Contact your local
System Administrator to confirm the availability of the interfaces in
the dat.conf file.
#
[specified include and exclude]
ERROR: You have specified both the btl_udapl_if_include and
btl_udapl_if_exclude MCA parameters.  These two parameters are
mutually exclusive; you can only specify one or the other.

For reference, the values that you specified are:

    btl_udapl_if_include: %s
    btl_udapl_if_exclude: %s
#
[nonexistent entry]
WARNING: One or more nonexistent interfaces were specified:

    Host:                 %s
    MCA parameter:        btl_udapl_if_%sclude
    Nonexistent entities: %s

These entities will be ignored.
#
[IPv4 only]
WARNING: uDAPL BTL only supports IPv4 addressing at this time.
Something other than an IPv4 address was detected on %s.
#
[no network match]
WARNING: Interface %s on node %s not able to find matching 
interface on peer node %s. Could be that the interfaces are on
different subnets or there are fewer available uDAPL interfaces on peer.
#
[interface not found]
WARNING: Host %s, not able to determine interface name for 
address %s. Will attempt to continue, assuming all addresses to
peer are reachable.
#
[netmask not found]
WARNING: Host %s, not able to determine netmask for address 
%s. Will attempt to continue assuming all addresses to 
peer are reachable.
#
[relaxed order support]
WARNING: While attempting to open interface %s the system reported
DAT_INVALID_RO_COOKIE. This indicates the currrent system supports
relaxed ordering. An attempt will be made to open the interface using
the following modified interface name %s. Open MPI must not use RDMA
for short eager messages in this scenario. Therefore, if opened
successfully RDMA will not be used for short eager messages. This will
negatively impact short message latency.
#
[dat_ia_open fail RO]
WARNING: Failed to open "%s" [%s:%s]. 
Attempted to call dat_ia_open() on an interface that has been prefixed
with "RO_AWARE_" after first trying to open %s and failed with
DAT_INVALID_RO_COOKIE.
