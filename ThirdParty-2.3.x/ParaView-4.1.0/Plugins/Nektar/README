ParaView NekTar Reader Plugin

Building the components:

----------------

NEKTAR_OBJECT:
cd to NEKTAR_OBJECT
Edit: Makefile and set VTK_DIR appropriately
build command: make

This is a small class used for caching data. It may be possible
to move this into the NEKTAR_READER_MPI dir, but it was not clear
to me how to get CMake to build this correctly there.

----------------

Nektar-PARALLEL:
You currently need to cd to each of the following directories
to build the given individual components:

First, edit:
Flags/Linux.inc and set MPI_DIR appropriately

gs:
build command: make ARCH=Linux mopt PARALLEL=1

Hlib/Linux:
build command: make ARCH=Linux mopt PARALLEL=1

Metis/metis-4.0/Lib:
build command: make

Utilities/Linux:
build command: make ARCH=Linux mopt PARALLEL=1
Currently, there is a version of BLAS and LAPACK that live in this directory
(built on Linux x86_64)  Not sure of the best way to resolve these
dependencies. Should the source be distributed?  Should they be
external dependencies?

Veclib:
build command: make ARCH=Linux OPTM=1

----------------

NEKTAR_READER_MPI:

Edit: CMakeLists.txt
Replace all instances of "/home/insley/TEST" with the
correct path to the PV_NEKTAR directory.

The last 3 libraries in TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES are external dependancies:
libblas.a
liblapack.a
libgfortran.a

I'm not sure of the best way of including these in the distribution, or even
if they should be included.


Generate a Makefile using CMake.
