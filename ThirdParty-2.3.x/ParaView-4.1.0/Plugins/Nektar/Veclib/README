  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  This file contains a description of the routines currently implemented
  in the C VecLib library.  Documentation on these routines can be found
  in the iPSC/2 Programmers Reference Manual.

  The library is divided functionally into three areas: vector operations
  (1-8), linear systems (9), and memory management (10).  The linear sys-
  tems routines are all from LINPACK.  More most routines, there are a
  variety of precisions available, as well as FORTRAN-callable versions.
  For more specific documentation on an individual routine, try checking
  the source file.

  Not all VecLib routines are included in this library
