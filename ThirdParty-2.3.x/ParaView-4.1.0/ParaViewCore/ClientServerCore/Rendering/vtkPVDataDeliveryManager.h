// .NAME vtkPVDataDeliveryManager - manager for data-delivery.
// .SECTION Description
// vtkPVDataDeliveryManager manages geometry delivering for rendering. It is
// used by vtkPVRenderView to manage the delivery of geometry to the nodes where
// rendering is happening. This class helps us consolidate all the code for
// delivering different types of geometries to all the nodes involved as well we
// a managing idiosyncrasies like requiring delivering to all nodes,
// redistributing for ordered compositing, etc.

  // Description:
  // View uses these methods to register a representation with the storage. This
  // makes it possible for representations to communicate with the storage
  // directly using a self pointer, while enables views on different processes
  // to communicate information about representations using their unique ids.

  // Description:
  // Representations (indirectly via vtkPVRenderView::SetPiece()) call this
  // method to register the geometry type they are rendering. Every
  // representation that requires delivering of any geometry must register with
  // the vtkPVDataDeliveryManager and never manage the delivery on its own.
  void SetPiece(vtkPVDataRepresentation* repr, vtkDataObject* data, bool low_res);
  void SetPiece(unsigned int repr_id, vtkDataObject* data, bool low_res);

  // Description:
  // Provides access to the producer port for the geometry of a registered
  // representation. Representations use these methods (indirectly via
  // vtkPVRenderView::GetPieceProducer() and GetPieceProducerLOD()) to obtain
  // the geometry producer for the geometry to be rendered.
  vtkAlgorithmOutput* GetProducer(vtkPVDataRepresentation*, bool low_res);

  // Description:
  // By default, this class only delivers geometries to nodes that are doing the
  // rendering at a given stage. However, certain representations, such as
  // data-label representation, or cube-axes representation, need to the
  // geometry to be delivered to all nodes always. That can be done by using
  // this method (via vtkPVRenderView::SetDeliverToAllProcesses()).
  void SetDeliverToAllProcesses(vtkPVDataRepresentation*, bool flag, bool low_res);

  // Description:
  // By default, this class only delivers geometries to nodes that are doing the
  // rendering at a given stage. However, certain representations, such as
  // text-source representation, need to the geometry to be delivered to  the
  // client as well.  That can be done by using this method (via
  // vtkPVRenderView::SetDeliverToAllProcesses()). The different between
  // SetDeliverToAllProcesses() and this is that the former gather-and-scatters
  // the data on the server nodes, while the latter will optionally gather the data to
  // deliver to the client and never scatter.
  void SetDeliverToClientAndRenderingProcesses(
    vtkPVDataRepresentation*, bool deliver_to_client,
    bool gather_before_delivery, bool low_res);

  // Description:
  // Under certain cases, e.g. when remote rendering in parallel with
  // translucent geometry, the geometry may need to be redistributed to ensure
  // ordered compositing can be employed correctly. Marking geometry provided by
  // a representation as redistributable makes it possible for this class to
  // redistribute the geometry as needed. Only vtkPolyData, vtkUnstructuredGrid
  // or a multi-block comprising of vtkPolyData is currently supported.
  void MarkAsRedistributable(vtkPVDataRepresentation*, bool value=true);

  // Description:
  // Returns the size for all visible geometry. If low_res is true, and low-res
  // data is not available for a particular representation, then it's high-res
  // data size will be used assuming that the representation is going to render
  // the high-res geometry for low-res rendering as well.
  unsigned long GetVisibleDataSize(bool low_res);

  // Description:
  // Provides access to the partitioning kd-tree that was generated using the
  // data provided by the representations. The view uses this kd-tree to decide
  // on the compositing order when ordered compositing is being used.
  vtkPKdTree* GetKdTree();

  // Description:
  // Get/Set the render-view. The view is not reference counted.
  void SetRenderView(vtkPVRenderView*);

  // Description:
  // Called by the view on ever render when ordered compositing is to be used to
  // ensure that the geometries are redistributed, as needed.

  // Pass the structured-meta-data for determining rendering order for ordered
  // compositing.

//BTX
  // Description:
  // Internal method used to determine the list of representations that need
  // their geometry delivered. This is done on the "client" side, with the
  // client decide what geometries it needs and then requests those from the
  // server-sides using Deliver().

  // it is streamable i.e. the view can call streaming passses on it and it will
  // deliver data incrementally.
  void SetStreamable(vtkPVDataRepresentation*, bool);
