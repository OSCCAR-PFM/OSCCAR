Welcome to the IceT build process.  IceT uses CMake to automatically
tailor itself to your system, so compiling should be relatively painless.
Before building IceT you will need to install CMake on your system.  You
can get CMake from www.cmake.org.

Once CMake is installed and the IceT source is extracted, run the
interactive CMake configuration tool.  On UNIX, run ccmake.  On Win32, run
the CMake program on the desktop or in the start menu.  Note that when
using the interactive configuration tool, you will need to ``configure''
several times before you can generate the build files.  This is because as
more information is retrieved, futher options are revealed.

After CMake generates build files, compile the applications as applicable
for your system.
