                            <p>When the ParaView application starts up, you see a 3D viewport with an axes at the center. This is a view. In ParaView, views are frames in which the data can be seen. There are different types of views. The default view that shows up is a 3D view which shows rendering of the geometry extracted from the data or volumes or slices in a 3D scene. You can change the default view in the Settings dialog (<strong>Edit</strong> | Settings (in case of Mac OS X, <strong>ParaView</strong> | Preferences)).</p>

                            <p>There may be parameters that are available to the user that control how the data is displayed e.g. in case of 3D view, the data can be displayed as wireframes or surfaces, where the user selects the color of the surface or uses a scalar for coloring etc. All these options are known as Display properties and are accessible from the Display tab in the Object Inspector. </p>
                            <p>Since there can be multiple datasets shown in a view, as well as multiple views, the Display tabs shows the properties for the active pipeline object (changed by using the Pipeline Browser, for example) in the active view. </p>
                            <p>ParaView supports showing multiple views side by side. To create multiple views, use the controls in the top right corner of the view to split the frame vertically or horizontally. You can also maximize a particular view to temporarily hide other views. Once a view-frame is split, you will see a list of buttons showing the different types of views that you can create to place in that view. Simply click the button to create the view of your choice. </p>
                            <p>You can swap view position by dragging the title bar for a view frame and dropping it into the title bar for another view. </p>

                            <p>Starting with ParaView 3.14, users can create multiple tabs to hold a grid of views. When in tile-display mode, only the active tab is shown on the tile-display. Thus, this can be used as a easy mechanism for switching views shown on a tile display for presentations. </p>

                            <p>Some filters, such as Plot Over Line may automatically split the view frame and show the data in a particular type of view suitable for the data generated by the filter. </p>
                            <p>Once you have multiple views, the active view is indicated by a colored border around the view frame. Several menus as well as toolbar buttons affect the active view alone. Additionally, they may become enabled/disabled based on whether that corresponding action is supported by the active view. </p>
                            <p>The Display tab affects the active view. Similarly, the eye icon in the Pipeline Browser, next to the pipeline objects, indicates the visibility state for that object in the active view. </p>
                            <p>When a new filter, source or reader is created, if possible it will be displayed by default in the active view, otherwise, if will create a new view. </p>

                            <p>This section covers the different types of views available in ParaView. For each view, we will talk about the controls available to change the view parameters using View Settings as well as the parameters associated with the <strong>Display Tab</strong> for showing data in that view.</p>
                            <p>3D view is used to show the surface or volume rendering for the data in a 3D world. This is the most commonly used view type. </p>
                            <p>When running in client-server mode, 3D view can render data either by bringing the geometry to the client and then rendering it there or by rendering it on the server (possibly in parallel) and then delivering the composited images to the client. Refer to the <strong>Client-Server Visualization</strong> chapter for details.</p>
                            <p>This view can also be used to visualize 2D dataset by switching its interaction mode to the 2D mode. This can be achieved by clicking on the button labelled "3D" in the view local toolbar. The label will automatically turn to 2D and the 2D interaction will be used as well as parallel projection.  </p>
                            <p>Interacting with the 3D view will typically update the camera. This makes it possible to explore the visualization scene. The default buttons are shown in Table 4.1 and  they can be changed using the Application Settings dialog. </p>

Use the Transform filter if you want to transform the data instead. </p>
                            <p>This view does not exist anymore as it has been replaced by a more flexible 3D view that can switch from a 3D to 2D mode dynamically. For more information, please see the 3D view section. </p>
                            <p>Spreadsheet View is used to inspect the raw data in a spreadsheet. When running in client-server mode, to avoid delivering the entire dataset to the client for displaying in the spreadsheet (since the data can be very large), this view streams only visible chunks of the data to the client. As the user scrolls around the spreadsheet, new data chunks are fetched. </p>
                            <p>Unlike some other views, this view can only show one dataset at a time. For composite datasets, it shows only one block at a time. You can select the block to show using the Display tab. </p>
                            <p> In regards to usability, this view behaves like typical spreadsheets shown in applications like Microsoft Excel or Apple Pages: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p> You can scroll up and down to inspect new rows.  </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> You can sort any column by clicking on the header for the column. Repeated clicking on the column header toggles the sorting order. When running in parallel, ParaView uses sophisticated parallel sorting algorithms to avoid memory and communication overheads to sort large, distributed datasets. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> You can double-click on a column header to toggle a mode in which only that column is visible. This reduces clutter when you are interested in a single attribute array. </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> You can click on rows to select the corresponding elements i.e. cells or points. This is not available when in "Show selected only mode." Also, when you create a selection in other views e.g. the 3D view, the rows corresponding to the selected elements will be highlighted. </p>
                                </li>

                            <p>Since this view can only show one dataset at a time, you can quickly choose the dataset to show using the Showing combo box. You can choose the attribute type i.e. point attributes, cell attributes, to display using the Attribute combo box. The Precision option controls the number of digits to show after decimal point for floating point numbers. Lastly, the last button allows the user to enter the view in a mode where it only shows the selected rows. This is useful when you create a selection using another view such as the 3D view and want to inspect the details for the selected cells or points. </p>

                            <p>The display properties for this view provide the same functionality as the header. Additionally, when dealing with composite datasets, the display tab shows a widget allowing the user to choose the block to display in the view. </p>
                            <p>A traditional 2D line plot is often the best option to show trends in small quantities of data. A line plot is also a good choice to examine relationships between different data values that vary over the same domain. </p>
                            <p>Any reader, source, or filter that produces plottable data can be displayed in an XY plot view. ParaView stores its plotable data in a table (vtkTable). Using the display properties, users can choose which columns in the table must be plotted on the X and Y axes. </p>
                            <p>As with the other view types, what is displayed in the active XY plot view is displayed by and controllable with the eye icons in the Pipeline Browser panel. When an XY plot view is active, only those filters that produce plotable output have eye icons. </p>
                            <p>The XY plot view is the preferred view type for the Plot over Line, Plot Point over Time, Plot Cell over Time, Plot Field Variable over Time, and Probe Location over Time filters. Creating any one of these filters will automatically create an XY plot view for displaying its output. Figure 4.19 shows a plot of the data values within a volume as they vary along three separate paths. The top curve comes from the line running across the center of the volume, where the largest values lie. The other two curves come from lines running near the edges of the volume. </p>
                            <p>Unlike the 3D and 2D render view, the charting views are client-side views i.e. they deliver the data to be plotted to the client. Hence ParaView only allows results from some standard filters such as Plot over Line in the line chart view by default. However it is also possible to plot cell or point data arrays for any dataset by apply the Plot Data filter. </p>

                            <p>Traditional 2D graphs present some types of information much more readily than 3D renderings do; they are usually the best choice for displaying one and two dimensional data. The bar chart view is very useful for examining the relative quantities of different values within data, for example.  </p>
                            <p>The bar chart view is used most frequently to display the output of the histogram filter. This filter divides the range of a component of a specified array from the input data set into a specified number of bins, producing a simple sequence of the number of values in the range of each bin. A bar chart is the natural choice for displaying this type of data. In fact, the bar chart view is the preferred view type for the histogram filter. Filters that have a preferred view type will create a view of the preferred type whenever they are instantiated. </p>
                            <p>When the new view is created for the histogram filter, the pre-existing 3D view is made smaller to make space for the new chart view. The chart view then becomes the active view, which is denoted with a red border around the view in the display area. Clicking on any view window makes it the active view. The contents of the Object Inspector and Pipeline Browser panels change and menu items are enabled or disabled whenever a different view becomes active to reflect the active view’s settings and available controls. In this way, you can independently control numerous views. Simply make a view active, and then use the rest of the GUI to change it. By default, the changes you make will only affect the active view. </p>
                            <p>As with the 3D View, the visibility of different datasets within a bar chart view is displayed and controlled by the eye icons in the Pipeline Browser. The bar chart view can only display datasets that contain chartable data, and when a bar chart view is active, the Pipeline Browser will only display the eye icon next to those datasets that can be charted.  </p>
                            <p>ParaView stores its chartable data in 1D Rectilinear Grids, where the X locations of the grid contain the bin boundaries, and the cell data contain the counts within each bin. Any source or filter that produces data in this format can be displayed in the bar chart view. Figure 4.25 shows a histogram of the values from a slice of a data set. </p>
                            <p>The Edit View Options for chart views dialog allows you to create labels, titles, and legends for the chart and to control the range and scaling of each axis. </p>

                            <p>The new Plot-Matrix-View (PMV) allows visualization of multiple dimensions of your data in one compact form. It also allows you to spot patterns in the small scatter plots, change focus to those plots of interest and perform basic selection. It is still at an early stage, but the basic features should already be useable, including iterative selection for all charts (add, remove and toggle selections with Ctrl or Shift modifiers on mouse actions too). </p>
                            <p>The PMV can be used to manage the array of plots and the vtkTable mapping of columns to input of the charts. Any filters or sources with an output of vtkTable type should be able to use the view type to display their output. The PMV include a scatter plot, which consists of charts generated by plotting all vtkTable columns against each other, bar charts (histograms) of vtkTable columns, and an active plot which shows the active chart that is selected in the scatter plot. The view offer offers new selection interactions to the charts, which will be describe below in details. </p>
                            <p>As with the other view types, what is displayed in the active PMV is displayed by and controllable with the eye icons in the Pipeline Browser panel. Like XY chart views, the PMVs are also client-side views i.e. they deliver the data to be plotted to the client. </p>

                            <p>The Quad View come from a plugin that is provided along with ParaView. That view allow the user to slice along 3 planes any data that get shown into it. A point widget is used to represent the planes intersection across all the view and can be grabbed and moved regardless the view we are interacting with. Information such as intersection position for each axis is represented with a text label in each of the slice view. The slice views behave as 2D views by providing pan and zoom interaction as well as parallel projection. In the bottom-right quarter there is a regular 3D view that can contains the objects that are sliced but this object can be shown using a regular representations or the "Slices" one which will show an Outline with the corresponding 3 cuts inside it. </p>

Pressing the Edit Color Map button displays the interface for manipulating the color map and scalar bar. The UI of Color Scale Editor as been both simplified and improved in many way. The first time the Color Editor get shown, it will appear in its simple mode which appears to be enough for most ParaView users. Although, in order to get full control on the Color Mapping in ParaView, you will need to select the Advanced checkbox. For volume representation, the UI was fully revisited for a better management but for other type of representations, the color editor is pretty much the same except that some buttons are rearranged and there are two more UI components added. The status of the Advanced checkbox is kept into ParaView internal settings therefore the next time you get back to the Color Editor it will allow come back the way you use it. </p>

                            <p>The two new UI controls are "Render View Immediately" checkbox and "Apply" button so that users can have control whether the render views should be updated immediately while editing the color transfer functions. This is very helpful when working with very large dataset. </p>
                            <p>The main changes for the color editor is the separation of editing opacity function from the color-editing function for volume representation. For surface representation, only one color-editing widget will show up (see screenshot "Surface Color Editor"), which is essentially the same as before. The scalar range of this color map editor is shown below the Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range check box. The leftmost sphere corresponds to the minimum scalar value, and the rightmost one corresponds to the maximum. Any interior nodes correspond to values between these two extremes. New nodes may be added to the color editor by left-clicking in the editor; this determines the scalar value associated with the node, but that value may be changed by typing a new value in the Scalar Value text box below the color map editor or by clicking and dragging a node. The scalar value for a particular node may not be changed such that it is less than that for a node left of it or greater than that for a node right of it.  </p>
                            <p>When volume rendering (see screenshot "Volume Color Editor", two function-editing widgets will show up: the top color-editing widget behave the same as for surface representation, which is used for editing scalar colors; the second one is the new opacity-editing widget for editing opacity only. The vertical height of a node indicates its opacity. Also, as in the color-editing widget, the leftmost sphere corresponds to the minimum scalar value, and the rightmost one corresponds to the maximum. Any interior nodes correspond to values between these two extremes. Again, new nodes may be added to the opacity-editor by left-clicking in the editor; this determines the scalar value associated with the node, but that value may be changed by typing a new value in the Scalar Value text box below the opacity editor or by clicking and dragging a node. Some new features are added to edit the opacity function (see below screenshot "Opacity Function Editor", which is the same editor as "Volume Color Editor", but resized vertically to have more space to show the opacity-editor) </p>

                                <strong>Opacity Function Editor</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>When a node is double-clicked in the opacity editor, four green handle widgets will be displayed based on the middle point position and curve sharpness between this node and the nodes before and after it. When the mouse is moved over the green sphere handle, it will become active (its center changes to magenta color) and can be dragged to adjust the middle point position (horizontal handle) or curve sharpness (vertical handle). To exit this mode, just click on another node. </p>
                            <p>When a node in the color-editor is clicked, it becomes highlighted (i.e., drawn larger than the other spheres in the editor). In the "Volume Color Editor" above, the third node from the left has been selected. Clicking again on the selected node displays a color selector from which you may select a new color for the node. The new color will also be applied to the opacity-editor. Pressing the ‘d’ or Delete key while a node is selected removes that node from the color-editor. Only the endpoint nodes may not be deleted. The same is true for removing nodes from opacity-editor. </p>
                            <p>For surface rendering, opacity is determined for an entire data set, not based on the underlying scalar values. </p>
                            <p>Below the color-editor is a text box for changing the scalar value associated with a given node. Only the scalar value is associated with surface rendering. The scalar values at the endpoints may only be changed if the Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range check box (discussed later in this section) is unmarked. When volume rendering, there are a set of three text boxes below opacity-editor that you may specify the scalar value, its opacity and scale per node in the editor for the selected node. In volume rendering, the opacity is accumulated as you step through the volume being rendered. The Scale value determines the unit distance over which the opacity is accumulated. </p>
                            <p>There are also controls to specify the color space and any color map preset you wish to save or use. The color spaces available are <strong>RGB</strong> (red, green, blue), <strong>HSV</strong> (hue, saturation, value), <strong>Wrapped HSV</strong>, and <strong>CIELAB</strong> (a more perceptually linear color space). The color space determines how the colors are interpolated between specified values; the colors at the color map (or transfer function) editor nodes will remain the same regardless of the color space chosen. If wrapped HSV is used, the interpolation will use the shortest path in hue, even going through the value hue = 0. For non-wrapped HSV, the hue interpolation will not pass through 0. A hue of zero sets the color to red.</p>
                            <p>In addition to choosing the color space and modifying the color map or transfer function nodes, you may also create and load preset color scales. When volume rendering, only the color map is stored; the scalar-to-opacity mapping is not. To store your current settings as a preset, click the Save button. In the dialog box that appears, you may enter a name for your new preset. By default, the scalar values from the data array being used are stored in the preset. If you wish these values to be normalized between 0 and 1, press the Normalize button. </p>

                                <strong>Figure 4.27</strong> Dialog for selecting color scale presets</p>
                            <p>Any presets you save, in addition to the default ones provided by ParaView, are available by pressing the Choose Preset button, causing the dialog shown below to be displayed. Selecting a preset and clicking OK causes the current color map to be set to the chosen preset. Any user-defined presets may be normalized (as discussed above) or removed from the list of presets entirely using the Normalize and Remove buttons, respectively. The default presets are already normalized and may not be removed from the application. </p>
                            <p>Any of the color scale presets may be exported to a file using the Export button in the above dialog. The resulting file(s) may then be copied to another computer for use with ParaView on a different machine. In order to load presets that are stored in such files, press the Import button on the above dialog, and navigate to the desired color preset file. </p>
                            <p>If the current dataset is colored by an array of vectors, the Component menu will be enabled. It determines whether the data is colored by a single vector component (X, Y, or Z) or by the vector’s Magnitude (the default). If the data is colored by a single-component (scalar) array, then the Component menu is disabled. </p>
                            <p>If Use Logarithmic Scale  is checked, then instead of the scalar values in the data array being used directly to determine the colors, the base-10 logarithm of the data array values is computed, and the resulting value is used for extracting a color from the color map. If the data array contains values for which a logarithm would produce invalid results (i.e., any values less than or equal to 0), the range for the color map is changed to [0, 10] so that the logarithm produces valid results. </p>
                            <p>By default, any data attribute that has been used to color a dataset currently loaded in ParaView, and whose name and number of components match that of the array selected in the Color by menu, contributes to the range of the color map. To change this behavior, first uncheck the Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range check box. This ensures that the range of the color map is not reset when the range of the data attribute changes. The minimum and maximum values of the color map can be overridden by pressing the Rescale Range button, entering different Minimum and Maximum values in the dialog that appears, and pressing Rescale. This rescales all the nodes in the color map so that the scalar values lie at the same normalized positions. Alternatively, you may modify the scalar values of any node (including the endpoints if Automatically Rescale to Fit Data Range is off) by clicking a node to highlight it and typing a new value in the Scalar Value entry box. By changing the minimum and maximum color map values, it is possible to manually specify what range of data values the color map will cover. Pressing the Rescale to Data Range button on the Color Scale tab of the Color Scale Editor sets the range to cover only the current data set. </p>
                            <p>If Use Discrete Colors is checked, the Resolution slider at the bottom of the dialog specifies the number of colors to use in the color map. The scale ranges from 2 to 256 (the default). The fewer the number of colors, the larger the range each color covers. This is useful if the data attribute has a small number of distinct values or if larger ranges of the array values should be mapped to the same color. </p>
