                            <p>ParaView comes with plethora of functionality bundled in: several readers, multitude of filters, quite a few different types of views etc. However, it is not uncommon for developers to add new functionality to ParaView. For example to add support for their new file format, incorporate a new filter, etc. ParaView makes it possible to add new functionlity by using an extensive plugin mechanism.  </p>
                            <p>Plugins can be used to extend ParaView in several ways: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                    <p> Add new writers </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Add new filters  </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Add new GUI components </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>

                            </ul>
                            <p/>
                            <p>Plugins are distributed as shared libraries (*.so on Unix, *.dylib on Mac, *.dll on Windows etc). For a plugin to be loadable in ParaView, it must be built with the same version of ParaView as it is expected to be deployed on. Plugins can be classified into two broad categories: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Server-side plugins </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p/> These are plugins that extend the algorithmic capabilities for ParaView eg. new filters, readers, writers etc. Since in ParaView data is processed on the server-side, these plugins need to be loaded on the server. <p/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Client-side plugins </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p/> These are plugins that extend the ParaView GUI eg. property panels for new filters, toolbars, views etc. These plugins need to be loaded on the client. <p>Oftentimes a plugin has both server-side as well as client-side components to it eg. a plugin that adds a new filter and a property panel that goes with that filter. Such plugins need to be loaded both on the server as well as the client.  </p>
                            <p>Generally, users don't have to worry whether a plugin is a server-side or client-side plugin. Simply load the plugin on the server as well as the client. ParaView will include relevant components from plugin on each of the processes.</p>

This reader support the staging capability of Adios which allow the user to pipe simulation kernels to post-processing tools : such as ParaView throw MPI communication channel and follow in live the computation with no disk IO.  <ul>

                            </ul> The H5Part Reader plugin adds support for reading particle datasets stored in H5Part format. H5Part is a simple wrapper around the HDF5 library and provides a number of convenience functions to manage time steps and access field arrays. The reader supports parallel reading of data using hyperslabs, when used with ParaView compiled with MPI and HDF5 with parallel IO enabled, the reader automatically uses hyperslabs to read portions of data on each process. <ul>

                            </ul> Adds a renderer for point geometry - in particular particle based datasets (though any point based data may be rendered using the provided painter). The plugin permits 3 modes of rendering, which are (in increasing order of complexity), Simple points, texture mapped sprites, and GPU raytraced spheres. The simple point mode allows the user to select a scalar array for the opacity on a per point basis. The texture mode adds support for opacity and radius per point (particle) which is drawn using a user supplied texture (a sphere is provided by default). The GPU mode differs by evaluating a quadric ray/sphere intersection that allow objects to intersect correctly rather than ‘popping’ in and out of view as sprites do. Transfer function editors can be used to map radius/opacity values if simple non-linear lookups are required <ul>

All of the actions a user performs while building and modifying a pipeline in ParaView are captured by the plugin. This allows navigation of all of the pipeline versions that have previously been explored.  For more information about this plugin see [0]<ul>

                            </ul> This plugin illustrate how to add FieldData to your dataset to customize the CubeAxis that should be presented along with your data.  Typically this plugin allow a creation of a cube that can be sheared by the user by changing some parameters. By doing so, the CubeAxes can follow the generated shape by creating axis along non-orthogonal axis. Moreover, the cube axis can be replaced altogether by a single 3D crossed axis.  That plugin can also be used just to provide a customized cube axes inside you 3D scene without changing any of your original reader of filter with those extra-annotation. <ul>

The Plugin Manager has two sections for loading local plugins and remote plugins (enabled only when connected to a server). To load a plugin on the local as well as remote side, simply browse to the plugin shared library. If the loading is successful, the plugin will appear in the list of loaded plugins. The Plugin manager also lists the paths it searched to load plugins automatically. The Plugin Manager remembers all loaded plugins, so next time to load the plugin, simply locate it in the list and click "Load Selected" button.   You can set up ParaView to automatically load the plugin at startup (in case of client-side plugins) or on connecting to the server (in case of server-side plugins) by checking the "Auto Load" checkbox on a loaded plugin. <p align="center">

                            <p/> If one wants ParaView to automatically load a set of plugins on startup, one can use the <strong>PV_PLUGIN_PATH</strong> environment variable. <strong>PV_PLUGIN_PATH</strong> can be used to list a set of directories (separated by colon (:) or semi-colon (;)) which ParaView will search on startup to load plugins. This enviromnent variable needs to be set on both the client node to load local plugins as well as the remote server to load remote plugins. Note that plugins in PV_PLUGIN_PATH are always auto-loaded irrespective of the status of the "Auto Load" checkbox in the Plugin Manager.<p/>
