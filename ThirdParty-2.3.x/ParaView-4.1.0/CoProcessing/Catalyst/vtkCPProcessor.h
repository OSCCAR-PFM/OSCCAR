/// @defgroup CoProcessing ParaView CoProcessing
/// The CoProcessing library is designed to be called from parallel 
/// simulation codes to reduce the size of the information that is saved
/// while also keeping the important information available as results.

/// @ingroup CoProcessing
/// There are 3 distinct phases for the operation of a co-processor.\n
/// 1) Initialization -- set up for the run.\n
/// 2) Processing -- the run.\n
/// 3) Finalization -- clean up before exit.\n
/// The processing phase occurs repeatedly and is composed of two distinct steps,
/// namely 1) Configuration (see vtkCPProcessor::ProcessDataDescription) and
/// 2) Processing (see vtkCPProcessor::ProcessData).
///
/// Configuration step:\n
/// In the first step the Co-Processor implemntation is called with a
/// vtkDataDescription describing the data that the simulation can provide
/// This gives the Co-Processor implemntation a chance to identify what
/// (if any) of the available data it will process during this pass. By
/// default all of the avaible data is selected, so that if the Co-Processor
/// implementation does nothing it will receive all data during the Processing 
/// step. The Co-Processor implementation should extract what ever meta-data
/// it will need (or alternatively can save a reference to the DataDescription),
/// during the Processing step.
///
/// Processing step:\n
/// In the second step the Co-Processor implementation is called with the
/// actual data that it has been asked to provide, if any. If no data was
/// selected during the Configuration Step than the priovided vtkDataObject
/// may be NULL.
